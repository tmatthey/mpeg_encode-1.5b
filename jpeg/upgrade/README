UPGRADE to testrel2.tar.Z for decompression to raw data files

	'Raw' in this case means the output is the subsampled
YCbCr output from the jpeg file. It is written to a file
type I've dubbed .YCC.  All this is is an Interleaved file
format where one MCU's worth of Y is written followed by
one MCU's worth of Cb and then the the same for Cr. There
is no header so you must keep track of the image dimensions.

NOTE to Tom Lane: I have added some #define's and #ifndefs
to the headers to make the header files easier to integrate
into other applications. These include:

jpeglib.h  - Ifndefs around DCTSIZE and DCTSIZE2 to prevent
             redefinition problems.

jmorecfg.h - ifndef BOOLEAN_DEFINED around boolean typedef.

I would like it if these could be left in.

Thanks,
