***************************************************************
*      MPEG_Encodev1.2 upgrade By James Boucher
*      Boston University Multimedia Communications Lab
*
*	Replace the original mpeg_encodev1.2 modules with
* these six modified modules and link to the new libjpeg.a
* with raw output extensions to enable the encoder to
* handle BASE types: JPEG and JMOVIE. The jpeg will handle
* a 4:1:1 subsampled JFIF and a 2:1h-1:1v subsampled JFIF.
* Adding other formats is easy. Just write a filter extension
* to the readJPEG module in readframe.c.
* Note then JMOVIE conversion handles version 2 Parallax
* Jmovies by breaking them up first into sets of JFIF's,
* therefore you need write access to the directory holding
* the JMOVIE.

Integration issues:

	Both mpeg_encode and libjpeg.a have a function j_rev_dct
which are not identical. One of these has to be changed to
another function name and I suggest Berkeley do it since
IJG did write the module first.

	I have added #ifndefs around the definitions for
DCTSIZE and DCTSIZE2 in the jpeglib.h headers downloaded
in rawjpeg.tar.Z but there is no guarantee these will
be left in the v5 IJG release. The same conflict arose
with the definition of the boolean. Thats why I altered
general.h.

JMOVIE usage:

	If your jmovie is called filename.jpg, place
filename*.jpg as your input filename in your param file.
This tells the encoder where to place and find the numbers
placed in the extracted JFIF filenames.

Let me know if you have problems,
