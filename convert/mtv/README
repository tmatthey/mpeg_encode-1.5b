The executable is
"movieToVid"  and it's usage is

	movieToVid movieFile dataDir indexDir srcHostName

where

o movieFile is the J Movie file you want to convert

o dataDir is the cms directory where the raw data is stored.  I'm 
not sure where it is on your system, but it's near where "wally.au",
"wally.vid" and "wally.ofs" are.

o indexDir is the cms directory where the scripts are stored (e.g.,
"andre.script" is stored in this directory.

o srcHostName is the name of the machine which serves as the cmsource.

For example, on our system, data is stored on tweety.cs.berkeley.edu in
/n/tweety/vid2/data/jpeg/jmovies and the indices are stored in
/n/tweety/vid2/data/index.  The to convert the jpeg movie file
"morning-news",
I would use

% movieToVid morning-news /n/tweety/vid2/data/jpeg/jmovies \
	/n/tweety/vid2/data/index tweety.cs.berkeley.edu

This will create the following files:
 /n/tweety/vid2/data/jpeg/jmovies/morning-news.au is a sparc audio file
 /n/tweety/vid2/data/jpeg/jmovies/morning-news.vid has the raw video data
 /n/tweety/vid2/data/jpeg/jmovies/morning-news.ofs is the frame offset
file for the raw video data
 /n/tweety/vid2/data/index/morning-news.script is the script file that
can be played in the cm player.

You'll need about as much space in dataDir as the movie takes.  You can
kill the movie file once this command completes, if you like.
